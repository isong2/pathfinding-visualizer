Description:

This is a pathfinding visualizer project that shows how DFS, BFS, A*, and Recursive Division work.


How to run:

Note: this was created under Python 3.8.

Simply download the .py file and run it.


To play the game:

1. Click any node to make it a "start" node
2. Click any node to make it an "end" node
3. Once start and end have been placed, any nodes clicked after will be "blocks"
4. Right click to reset nodes to default
5. Once ready (start and end node placed as minimum requirement), press on keyboard:

   A. "a" - A* visualizer

   B. "b" - BFS visualizer

   C. "d" - DFS visualizer

   D. "r" - Recursive Division maze-creating visualizer

   E. "c" - clear board besides start and end

   F. "BACKSPACE" - clear the entire board


Libraries/Modules used:

Pygame, math, random, and queue
